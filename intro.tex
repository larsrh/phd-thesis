The first part of this thesis is concerned with the generation of executable code in a functional programming language from specifications in an interactive theorem prover.
I picked the \emph{CakeML} language (ยง\ref{sec:intro:cakeml}) and the \emph{Isabelle} prover (ยง\ref{sec:intro:isabelle}).
This chapter will give an introduction to those two systems and give a motivation why a connection between them is desirable (ยง\ref{sec:intro:motivation}).
