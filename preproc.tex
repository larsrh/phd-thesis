Before definitions can be processed by the compiler, a \emph{preprocessing} phase needs to modify them to remove unsupported features.
This chapter explains these steps, starting with the elimination of type classes (§\ref{sec:preproc:dict}), followed by lazy evaluation of case combinators (§\ref{sec:preproc:lazy}) and partially applied constructors (§\ref{sec:preproc:constructor}).
Finally, it deals with restrictions on pattern matching (§\ref{sec:preproc:compatibility}) and other limitations (§\ref{sec:preproc:limitations}).
