\section{Conclusion}

In this section, I have presented a formalization of a term algebra that abstracts over operations that are common in term rewriting.
This itself is not a novel idea, but it -- to the best of my knowledge -- the first implementation in a proof assistant.
I have demonstrated its applicability to other term formalizations, too, which could then benefit from a wealth of results.

Further work in this topic includes a generalized implementation of unification.
While this is not strictly necessary for this formalization, it would avoid duplicated formalization efforts for other applications.

The algebra also allows pain-free definition of different varieties of term types.
This simplifies the correctness proofs of the compiler phases, because each phase can use a tailored term type.
