\noindent
The compiler transforms the initial type of terms through various stages.
This section introduces necessary terminology (ยง\ref{sec:terms:prelim}) and gives an overview of the intermediate types (ยง\ref{sec:terms:types}).
All of them support similar notions such as ``free variables'', ``matching'' and ``substitution''.
This is abstracted in a \emph{term algebra} (ยง\ref{sec:terms:algebra}).
